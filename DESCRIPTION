Title: Fault-Tolerant and Resumable Functional Programming with Automatic Recovery
Version: 1.0.0

Description: SafeMapper provides drop-in replacements for purrr and furrr mapping functions
    with built-in fault tolerance, automatic checkpointing, and seamless recovery capabilities.
    It extends the popular purrr and furrr packages by adding robust error handling and progress
    persistence. SafeMapper solves the critical problem of losing computation progress when
    long-running mapping operations fail due to network issues, memory errors, system crashes,
    or other interruptions. The package automatically saves progress at configurable intervals
    and can resume from the exact point of failure, making it indispensable for large-scale
    data processing, API calls, web scraping, machine learning workflows, and other
    time-intensive operations where reliability and resumability are paramount.
