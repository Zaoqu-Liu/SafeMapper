Description: Provides drop-in replacements for 'purrr' and 'furrr' mapping 
    functions with built-in fault tolerance, automatic checkpointing, and 
    seamless recovery capabilities. When long-running computations are 
    interrupted due to errors, system crashes, or other failures, simply 
    re-run the same code to automatically resume from the last checkpoint. 
    Ideal for large-scale data processing, API calls, web scraping, and 
    other time-intensive operations where reliability is critical.
